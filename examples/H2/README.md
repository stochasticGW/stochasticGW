# H2 standalone example

This example demonstrates how to perform a basic stochastic GW calculation
to compute the ionization potential of H2. This example follows the tutorial
section in the StochasticGW user manual.

## Instructions

1. Run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. This will create links to all executables,
   pseudopotential files and input files needed for an sGW run.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md `file.
