# Graphene example

In this example we will compute the energies of the lowest 16 bands (8 occupied
and 8 vacant) of a 4-atom periodic sheet of graphene. We will perform a
stochastic GW calculation on each band and compare the sGW energies with the
DFT values.

## Instructions

1. Run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. This will create links to all executables,
   pseudopotential files and input files needed for an sGW run.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md `file.
