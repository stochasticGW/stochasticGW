# BN example

In this example we will compute the HOMO-LUMO gap of an 8-atom unit cell of BN
via stochastic GW. We will compare the HOMO-LUMO gap computed with a non-
stochastic treatment of W using projection, a stochastic treatment of W using
projection, and a stochastic treatment of W using gapped-filtering.

## Instructions

1. Run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. This will create links to all executables,
   pseudopotential files and input files needed for an sGW run.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md `file.
