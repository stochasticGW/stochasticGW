# naphthalene example

In this example we will compute the GW energy of the HOMO of naphthalene.
This example uses only one orbital and density instead of requiring the
entire wavefunction. Two algorithms for filtering the initial states
are compared, one using Heaviside filtering and the other using gapped
filtering. See: M. Nguyen and D. Neuhauser. "Gapped-filtering for efficient
Chebyshev expansion of the density projection operator." Chem. Phys. Lett.

## Instructions

1. Run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. This will create links to all executables,
   pseudopotential files and input files needed for an sGW run.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md `file.
