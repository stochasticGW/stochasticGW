# I2 example

This example tests the conversion of orbitals from Quantum Espresso to
StochasticGW. We vary the density of points in the spatial grid in the
preliminary Quantum Espresso calculation and check the energies of the
full set of orbitals as computed by StochasticGW.

## Instructions

1. Run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. This will create links to all executables,
   pseudopotential files and input files needed for an sGW run.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md `file.
