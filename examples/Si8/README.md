# Si8 example

In this example we will compute the energies of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of
bulk Silicon using and 8-atom unit cell. This example use gapped filtering
to generate the inital stochastic states without requiring the full set of 
orbitals; instead, only the HOMO, LUMO, and density are used.

## Instructions

1. Run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. This will create links to all executables,
   pseudopotential files and input files needed for an sGW run.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md `file.
