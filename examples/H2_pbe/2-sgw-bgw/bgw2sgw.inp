# Input charge-density file, in BerkeleyGW format. This is optional.

# Output charge-density file, for StochasticGW calculations using stochastic
# orbitals, in text format. Defaults to dens.txt. The output charge-density

# Output wavefunction file, for StochasticGW calculations using deterministic
# orbitals, in text or binary format. Defaults to wf.bin. The output wavefunction
# file will only be written only if [[input_wfn_file]] is specified.
