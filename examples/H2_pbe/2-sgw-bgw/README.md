# H2 PBE example, stochastic GW calculation from intermediate BerkeleyGW step.

In this step we will compute the ionization potential of H2 using StochasticGW.
Here, we will use the `bgw2sgw` tool provided in the BerkeleyGW package to 
generate the required sGW inputs from the `RHO` and `WFN` files previously
generated by `pw2bgw`.

1. Examine `bgw2sgw.inp`, which contains settings for the `bgw2sgw` tool.

2. Run `./bgw2sgw.x > bgw2sgw.out`. This produces two files, `cnt.ini` and
   `wf.bin`, which contain the atomic coordinates and wavefunction for sGW,
   respectively.

3. Examine the sGW input file, `INPUT`. Note that, unlike in the standalone
   example, we specify the density functional via its LibXC code. Note also
   that 'box' must be set to 'pos' when using `bgw2sgw` to prepare the sGW
   inputs.

4. Run `./sgw.x` (or, on an HPC cluster, call `sgw_gpu.x` using an appropriate
   job script). Examine the output file and compare the result to the value
   in the Tutorial.
