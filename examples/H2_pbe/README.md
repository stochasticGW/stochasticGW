# H2 PBE example

In this example we will perform stochastic GW calculations to compute the 
ionization potential of H2. This example showcases two different methods for
preparing initial data for StochasticGW using the `bgw2sgw` and `qe2sgw` tools.
See "H2: Extracting wavefunctions from Quantum ESPRESSO and running GW/PBE" in
the StochasticGW User manual and Tutorial for a detailed description of the
calculation steps and inputs.

## Instructions

1. Run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. This will create links to all executables,
   pseudopotential files and input files needed for an sGW run.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md `file.
