# C60 example

In this example we will compute the electron affinity of C60 using a TDDFT
effective potential and compare this result to that using an RPA. The
wavefunction file should be either linked from the project directory in step 1
below or downloaded from [Daniel Neuhauser's research page](http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/dxn/pdf/wf.bin.gz).

## Instructions

1. Run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. This will create links to all executables,
   pseudopotential files and input files needed for an sGW run.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md `file.
