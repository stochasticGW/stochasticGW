# H2O example

In this example we will compute the matrix elements of the Sigma operator,
where Sigma = iGW, for the water molecule. Matrix elements involving the HOMO
and several occupied and empty orbitals will be computed using a deterministic
expansion of the W^R operator.

## Instructions

1. Run the script `./01-link_files.sh`. This will create links to all executables,
   pseudopotential files and input files needed for an sGW run.

2. Go to each directory in the numeric order they appear and follow the
   instructions in each `README.md `file.
