# INSTALLING AND RUNNING StochasticGW (version 3).

# Once you have cloned the stochasticGW GitHub repository in your main directory,
# the code is in ~/stochasticGW-GPU. Then navigate:

     cd ~/stochasticGW-GPU

# Go to the scripts/ directory

    cd scripts

# Copy a makefile that is appropriate for your architecture to the src directory, e.g.

    cp Makefile_nvidia ../src/Makefile

# Go to the src directory
    
    cd ../src

# Within src, change the compiler options in Makefile to your liking. At present they are:

  FCMPI   = mpifort
  MPIFLG  = -DMPI -O3
  PREPROCFLG = -Mpreprocess
  USEGPU = yes
  USELIBXC = no
  FFTPATH = -L ${FFTW_DIR} -lfftw3
  CUFLG = -lcudart
  CULIB = -L$(NVIDIA_PATH)/math_libs/lib64 -lcufft

# (note that setting 'USEGPU = yes' currently requires the NVIDIA compiler for building 
# the OpenACC GPU code; setting 'USELIBXC = yes' requies a prior installation of LIBXC)

# Exit Makefile, and compile the code:
  
    make

# Make sure that either 'sgw_gpu.x' or 'sgw_cpu.x' has been created:
  
    ls sgw*.x

# Now you are ready to execute the code!
# For example, consider the H2 test case. From the main stochasticGW-GPU
# directory, navigate to the example directory 'examples/H2 and follow the instructions
# in the 'README.md' file.
